# consoleSinger
ConsoleSinger is an simple Windows bot that can sing your favourite songs with you! Fully on english. Written in Processing - Java
# How to use

1. Download repo and go to folder application.windows32 if you are using 32 bit Windows, or if you use 64 bit Windows - application.windows64
2. Now edit lyrics.txt. Insert lyrics in it, but please remove newlines whitout words. 
```
Like that's a good string
Like that's a good string too
```
```
DO NOT DO LIKE THIS!

Another line
```
Lines must be collapsed, and have no special chars in them(idk what happens, but there were issues).

3. Open *.exe file and then enter some words from song lyrics, and the bot will start sjnging with you!
4. Done.

# This is pretty useless project
Maybe somebody will find some use for it, but it's too buggy and I am interested in making a professional discord bot that can do the same task.
